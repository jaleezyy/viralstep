							Percentage of target-bases covered at coverage >=10x as a function of the number of mapped reads. Sequencing depth simulations
							were carried out by randomly selecting <DEPTHLIST> reads from the bam file. For each of these sets of reads, the percentage of target-covered
							positions was calculated. This graph aims to give an idea on how much one can improve the percentage of target-bases covered by
							resequencing. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A flat curve on the right part indicates that resequencing will not improve the number of target-bases covered at 10x. A
							warning is issued if the curve does not tend to saturation on the right side (slope between the two last points > <WARNSATURATION>). If the maximum depth provided as input is greater
							than the number of reads in the bam file, the last x-value corresponds to the number of reads in the bam file.
